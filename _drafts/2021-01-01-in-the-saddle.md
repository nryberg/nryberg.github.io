This has been brewing for a while, so I'm going to deny the obvious tie in with January First, and just state for the record that I've been *meaning* to get back into the groove for a while.  

Now it's just a lot more intentional.  

During the black Friday sales, I took advantage of two learning opportunities, both regular visitors to the land of inexpensive but highly useful sources of inspiration - PragProg's book sale and Jon Calhoun's training discounts.

As a result, I've created a bit of a technology bake-off - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) vs. [Go Web](https://golang.org/) vs. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Starting points

### Rails and the PragProg Book Sale

I love [PragProg](https://pragprog.com) - great books, interesting authors and passionate editors.  While the selection is relatively slim (compared to the O'Reilly behemoth), the content they do have is excellent.

I purchased the [Rails Guide](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails6/agile-web-development-with-rails-6/) years ago, and was happy to see it updated.  Part of me worries that I'm dealing with "Old tech", but that's more than compensated by the broad adoption, bug squashing history, and simplicity built into the MVC approach.

### Go Web and Jon Calhoun

Every year he has his instruction course sale, and I jumped on it this time.  As always, it's thorough, approachable and solid.  [Learn to Create Web Applications using Go](https://www.usegolang.com/) is comprehensive and includes video, code and the textbook.

### Svelte

The [recent podcast](https://datastori.es/163-svelte-js-for-web-based-dataviz-with-amelia-wattenberger/) from Data Stories with guest Amelia Wattenberger really caught my ear.

The idea that you can rapidly develop D3 style visualizations sounds awesome.  With that motivation in hand, I went to the [O'Reilly site](https://learning.oreilly.com/) which in no sense of the word is cheap - however I have a work based pass.  

[Svelte 3 Up and Running](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/svelte-3-up) is a fantastic book.

## Current Status

As of January 1st, 2021, (just love saying that now), I've gotten this far:

* Rails - some hiccups with Webpacker (WTF), it's now running flawlessly and I can get back to coding.  Did not expect that hiccup and it still irritates a little
* Go for Web - played around with it, took the first couple of modules, and put it down. 
* Svelte - sounded good on the package, but after the 20th little custom configuration demanded bug fixes and tweaks, I finally put it down.  Grr.

## Toolsets

### Editor

My coding environment of choice now is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - there are so many fantastic IDEs out there now, I'm happy to go with a fairly mainstream and very well supported one.  It's odd to be relying on Microsoft in this way, but the prices is right and the community support is huge.

### Local Server

While I have a [Intel NUC]() which is great, I'm jumping on the Windows Subsystem for Linux bandwagon.  Ubuntu is what I've known for years, and it's pretty cool that it (mostly) just works right out of the box.

### Repository

[Github](https://github.com/nryberg) (yet another Microsoft tool?) is always my home, though I'm playing around a bit with Gitea, just because, you know.  

[Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - yes, I'm lame when it comes to git commands.  This stops the thinking process dead in its tracks, and oh yeah, eliminates a lot of newbie errors.

### (Future) Public Host

Almost certainly [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  Inexpensive and the UX is amazing.
